# Java

Java is a high-level, object-oriented, platform-independent programming language developed by Sun Microsystems in the mid-1990s (now owned by Oracle).

**1. JDK (Java Development Kit)**

Itâ€™s the full toolkit for developers.

Includes:

Compiler (javac) â†’ converts your .java code into bytecode (.class files).

JRE (Java Runtime Environment) â†’ so you can run what you write.

Tools like debuggers, profilers, and documentation generators.

Without JDK, you canâ€™t develop Java apps â€” only run them.

**2. JRE (Java Runtime Environment)**

Itâ€™s the package to run Java applications.

Includes:

JVM (Java Virtual Machine) â†’ executes bytecode.

Core Java libraries (collections, networking, IO, etc.).

End users who only need to run Java programs (not write them) just need JRE.

**3. JVM (Java Virtual Machine)**

The engine that makes Java platform-independent.

Takes compiled bytecode and translates it to machine code for the host OS.

Handles:

Memory management (via Garbage Collection).

Just-In-Time (JIT) compilation for faster execution.

Security checks (sandboxing for untrusted code).

***Flow of Execution***

You write Java code â†’ MyApp.java.

JDK compiler (javac) compiles it â†’ MyApp.class (bytecode).

JVM (inside JRE) loads and runs the bytecode on your OS.

Thanks to JVM, the same .class file runs on Windows, Mac, Linux, etc. without change.

ðŸ‘‰ In short:

JDK = for developers (write + run).

JRE = for users (just run).

JVM = the core engine that makes Java portable.

**What is Statement?**
It is a complete command to be executed. It can consist of one or more expressions.

**What are Keywords?**
A keyword is a reserved word that has predefined meaning in Java Language.

**What is an Expression?**
An expression is a coding construct that evaluates to a single value.

## Data Types:

**_Primitive Data Types (8):_**

These are built-in, simple, and not objects. Stored directly in memory.


| Data Type | Size     | Default Value | Example              | Range                       |
|-----------|----------|---------------|----------------------|-----------------------------|
| byte      | 8-bit    | 0             | `byte a = 100;`      | -128 to 127                 |
| short     | 16-bit   | 0             | `short s = 1000;`    | -32,768 to 32,767           |
| int       | 32-bit   | 0             | `int x = 50000;`     | -2^31 to 2^31 - 1           |
| long      | 64-bit   | 0L            | `long l = 100000L;`  | -2^63 to 2^63 - 1           |
| float     | 32-bit   | 0.0f          | `float f = 5.75f;`   | ~7 decimal digits precision |
| double    | 64-bit   | 0.0d          | `double d = 19.99;`  | ~15 decimal digits precision|
| char      | 16-bit   | '\u0000'      | `char c = 'A';`      | 0 to 65,535 (Unicode)       |
| boolean   | 1 bit*   | false         | `boolean flag = true;` | true / false              |

> *Note: `boolean` size is JVM-dependent, but logically treated as 1 bit.

**_Non-Primitive (Reference) Data Types(5):_**

| Data Type | Example |
|-----------|---------|
| String    | `String name = "Java";` |
| Array     | `int[] arr = {1, 2, 3};` |
| Class     | `class Student { ... }` |
| Interface | `interface Shape { ... }` |
| Enum      | `enum Level { LOW, MEDIUM, HIGH }` |
